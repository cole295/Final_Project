## Project thoughts

I am interested in exploring data related to the impact on the standard of living from the level of social safety net spending. As the United States sees bigger calls for increased healthcare, social security and other spending on social safety net programs, it would be intriguing to explore the degree to which standards of living are affected by such investments.

Another idea I had in mind for my research is to explore the effects unionization has on the workplace. This includes quality of work, compensation and benefits, turnover rate, etc. etc. We have seen an increasing number of strikes and union-related activities, and it would be interesting to see the benefits from unionization.
